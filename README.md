# alea

A [Quark](https://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingQuarks.html) which extends SuperCollider's Pattern library.

## Patterns for aleatory composition

This Quark provides a collection of Pattern classes designed for aleatory composition, aiming for the sweet spot between randomness and control.

So far, the following Patterns are included:

- Pshunc - shuffle and truncate a list of items
- Pmarkov - a first order Markov chain

## Installation

With Git and SuperCollider installed, run the following line of code in SuperCollider:
`Quarks.install("https://github.com/sparkletop/alea")`
